# Online Examination System
### Java (JSP) | MySQL | Apache Tomcat

A production-grade Online Examination System designed to solve real-world educational challenges in South Africa. This project demonstrates a complete, secure, and scalable web application for managing and conducting online assessments.


### 📊 Business Context
In many South African schools, the examination process is still heavily reliant on manual, paper-based methods. This leads to administrative overhead, security vulnerabilities, geographical limitations for remote learners, and a lack of timely feedback for students.

This **Online Examination System** solves these critical issues by providing:
✅ **Centralized & Secure Administration** for courses, questions, and user accounts.
✅ **Fair & Accessible Examinations** with features like randomized questions and timed tests.
✅ **Automated Grading & Instant Feedback** to accelerate learning cycles.
✅ **Reduced Administrative Burden** by automating the entire examination lifecycle.

### 🏗️ Architecture
**Data Model: Relational Schema**
The system is built on a robust relational database schema designed for data integrity and scalability.

**Key Design Choices:**
- **Normalized Schema:** Reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity.
- **BCrypt Hashing:** Passwords are never stored in plaintext, ensuring strong security.
- **Application-Managed Integrity:** Cascading deletes and updates are handled at the application layer to maintain data consistency across related tables.
- **Centralized Controller:** A single `controller.jsp` acts as a servlet to manage all business logic, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.

### 🚀 Features

**1. Secure User & Session Management**
- **Robust Authentication:** Secure login for Admins, Lecturers, and Students.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Users only see what they're authorized to, from admin dashboards to student exam portals.
- **Password Security:** Passwords are hashed using **jBCrypt**.
- **Session Management:** Secure sessions track user state throughout the application.

**2. Comprehensive Admin Dashboard**
- **User Management:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for all user accounts.
- **Course Administration:** Add, edit, and delete courses, set exam durations, and manage total marks.
- **Question Bank Management:** A centralized repository for creating, updating, and deleting exam questions for each course.
- **Activate/Deactivate Exams:** Control exam availability for students with a single click.

**3. Powerful Examination Engine**
- **Timed Examinations:** Each exam has a specific duration, and the system automatically submits when the time is up.
- **Randomized Questions:** Questions are pulled randomly from the question bank to ensure a fair and unique exam for each student.
- **Real-time Answer Saving:** Student answers are saved in real-time to prevent data loss.

**4. Automated Grading & Results**
- **Instantaneous Results:** The system automatically grades exams upon completion.
- **Detailed Result Reports:** Students and administrators can view detailed results, including obtained marks and pass/fail status.
- **Centralized Reporting:** Admins can view and manage all student results from a central dashboard.

### 📦 Installation & Setup

**Prerequisites**
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8+**
- **Apache Tomcat 8.5+**
- **MySQL Server 8.0+**
- **Apache Ant** (for building the project)
- **NetBeans IDE** (Recommended)

**Quick Start**
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Online-Examination-System.git
    cd Online-Examination-System
    ```
2.  **Database Setup:**
    - Create a new MySQL database named `exam_system`.
    - Import the schema from `db script/exam_system.sql`.
    - Update the database credentials in `src/java/myPackage/DatabaseClass.java` if they differ from the defaults (`root`/`root`).

3.  **Build the Project:**
    - Open the project in NetBeans and click "Run" to build and deploy to the integrated Tomcat server.
    - **Alternatively, build manually using Ant:**
      ```sh
      ant dist
      ```
      This will create a `Examination_System.war` file in the `dist/` directory.

4.  **Deploy to Tomcat:**
    - Copy the `Examination_System.war` file to the `webapps` directory of your Tomcat installation.
    - Start the Tomcat server.

5.  **Access the Application:**
    - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/Examination_System/`.
